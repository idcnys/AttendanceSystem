are the system files you don't need to modify them.
flask-session folder will automatically get created.

Working Process:
1. First Sumon/Rabbi/me will create a attendance sheet, and will provide
the link with all classmates. 
it will look like http://ip:5000 now users need to connect to a common
wifi/hotspot to access the link;

2. Enter the roll -> verify -> I am present
 on added-> user_ip will be stored, he cannot add more response in that session
3. One time limit will be provided: after that a pdf will get rendered
